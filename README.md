# utf8span
A small library for handling strings containing UTF8 encoded characters. <br>
Currently supported national characters are Polish and German.

<b>Utf8span may or may not own the data.</b> <br>
When utf8span is not the owner, the actual owner must ensure that the data lives longer than span.
